# Feed Reader Testing
This is project 6 for the Front End Web Developer Nanodegree Programme. In this project, I use Jasmine to develop unit test script on a front end web application that reads RSS feeds.

## Code Usage
1. Download the repository to your desktop.
2. Unzip the folder you just downloaded.
3. Open the `index.html`, and you should see the app along with its unit test results.

## Unit Tests on the Application
1. `allFeeds` variable is defined already.
2. Within `allFeeds`, each `feed` has a name and url defined already.
3. The menu is hidden by default.
4. The menu will be toggle by cliking the icon in the header.
5. When `loadFeed` function has been called, there must be at least one entry of feed.
6. When a new feed is read by `loadFeed`, the feed content should change.
